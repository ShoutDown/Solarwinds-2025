Good day, dear friend!
If you need software from Solarwinds but your company can't afford to buy a subscription for crazy money, I'm ready to help you solve this problem.

I worked for several weeks and achieved that the trial version was verified indefinitely, or more precisely until 9999, with full functionality and without restrictions on the number of nodes, ports, volumes.

You can activate any product with my mod:
NPM - Network Performance Monitor
EOC - Enterprise Operations Console
IPAM - IP Address Manager
NCM - Network Configuration Management
NTA - NetFlow Traffic Analyzer
VoIP and Network Quality Manager
SCM - Server Configuration Monitor

UDT - User Device Tracker
SAM - Server & Application Monitor
NAM - Network Automation Manager
LM - Log Management and Analysis
HA - High Availability
ACM - Application Centric Monitor

To check, we move the date forward and see that the software continues to work, counting down the days until 9999year
