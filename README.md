# Solarwinds-2025
Good day, dear friend.
I managed to bypass trial protection on SolarWinds programs, in particular Observability

Using Ildasm.exe, I found the dll file that is responsible for the trial period counter and, using the necessary tools, changed the code as a result, all trial licenses become infinite with full functionality until 9999 year.
I pay tribute to the Solarwinds developers, they did not even bother to use an obfuscator.

A couple of screenshots:
After modification the day counter is set to maximum:

To check, we move the date forward and see that the software continues to work, counting down the days until 9999year
